[11:39 PM] Slorany: so
[11:39 PM] Slorany: notifs from a channel or a server?
[11:39 PM] monowhule: Both?
[11:39 PM] Slorany: alright
[11:40 PM] Slorany: completely mute, or just no more big notifs?
[11:40 PM] monowhule: Mute? What do you mean?
[11:40 PM] Slorany: stop all notifs
[11:40 PM] Slorany: entirely
[11:40 PM] monowhule: I just want the little side-dot to stop popping up.
[11:40 PM] monowhule: It is giving me OCD.
[11:40 PM] Slorany: you can right click the icon of the server on the sidebar (left)
[11:40 PM] Slorany: -> Server Mute(edited)
[11:41 PM] Slorany: check the box
[11:41 PM] monowhule: Thanks.
[11:41 PM] Slorany: np
[11:42 PM] monowhule: I'm only on the Learn a Lang server for Esperanto anyway, since the /r/Esperanto server requires an e-mail verification.
[11:42 PM] Slorany: and you don't have that?
[11:42 PM] monowhule: I don't want to give them my information.
[11:42 PM] Slorany: give your info to whom?
[11:42 PM] monowhule: Exactly.
[11:42 PM] Slorany: the r/esperanto server or Discord?
[11:43 PM] monowhule: Either.
[11:43 PM] Slorany: eh
[11:43 PM] Slorany: fair enough
[11:43 PM] Slorany: but anyway, only Discord would be able to access it
[11:43 PM] Slorany: and it's just to check you're not a bot
[11:43 PM] monowhule: I hate signing up for shit.
[11:43 PM] monowhule: Like, a lot.
[11:44 PM] Slorany: Why not just set up a dummy mail address though?
[11:44 PM] monowhule: Because that just increases the problem.(edited)
[11:45 PM] Slorany: yeah but it also increases the number of things you have access to
[11:45 PM] Slorany: and it's a dummy account so the info leaked is null
[11:45 PM] monowhule: Ehn.
[11:45 PM] monowhule: If it requires sign-in it probably isn't worth visiting.
[11:46 PM] Slorany: I mean
[11:46 PM] Slorany: reddit
[11:46 PM] Slorany: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:46 PM] monowhule: And I already have too many accounts as it is.
[11:46 PM] Slorany: also, university websites are pretty worth a look if you ask me
[11:46 PM] Slorany: and they require sign-in
[11:46 PM] monowhule: All the good stuff is behind pay walls.
[11:47 PM] Slorany: Not really
[11:47 PM] Slorany: i mean
[11:47 PM] Slorany: > university websites
[11:48 PM] monowhule: ??
[11:48 PM] Slorany: Not everything good is behind a paywall
[11:48 PM] Slorany: for instance, university websites, as they're free ^^(edited)
[11:48 PM] monowhule: Like I said, I have enough accounts.
[11:49 PM] monowhule: Nothing good is free.
[11:49 PM] Slorany: Eh, well
[11:49 PM] Slorany: I don't agree with that
[11:50 PM] Slorany: Like, many artists don't sell their music and it can be pretty damn good
[11:50 PM] monowhule: I've never heard any.
[11:50 PM] Slorany: Have you even looked?
[11:50 PM] monowhule: Yes.
[11:50 PM] Slorany: i mean they're often on websites that require sign-in
[11:50 PM] monowhule: Meh.
[11:50 PM] monowhule: If it is worth finding, it will be in the open.
[11:51 PM] Slorany: Well then again, the argument of universities is there
[11:51 PM] Slorany: it's worth going to a university, yet it's not "open"
[11:52 PM] monowhule: Okay, that's enough diversion. Thank you for your help.
[11:52 PM] monowhule: Good bye.
[11:52 PM] Slorany: You're so sweet
[11:52 PM] monowhule: I'm having social issues right now.
[11:52 PM] monowhule: Don't be a dick.
[11:52 PM] Slorany: I'm not the one being a dick
[11:52 PM] Slorany: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:53 PM] Slorany: Have fun anyway!
[11:53 PM] monowhule: I asked you to stop.

[8:10 PM] Slorany: Hi,

We have decided to pull the "self" role from you. This makes it so you're now unable to see the following channels: selfies, venting, victory and relationships.

You have the possibility to appeal this decision either in the #meta channel or via private messages with the mods.
[8:11 PM] monowhule: For why?
[8:12 PM] Slorany: Your copypasta in the venting channel, which was in our eyes very disrespectful toward the community.
[8:12 PM] monowhule: ...Okay?
[8:22 PM] Slorany: If you wish to post blocks of text such as this one we have a spam chat
[8:25 PM] monowhule: ...Rude.
```
