Welcome to the beginning of the #laogai channel.
[2:40 PM] Slorany: Hello and welcome to Lake Laogai.

If you can see this channel, it means that you have broken the rules in a manner that required us to effectively block you from interacting with the rest of the server and that we are currently discussing how to react appropriately.
You may appeal to the moderators here.

[12:24 AM] Slorany: @here
[12:24 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: What is this?
[12:24 AM] Slorany: don't believe the message above
[12:24 AM] Slorany: it's here for general purposes
[12:25 AM] Slorany: Just, we wanted to let you know that several people on the server have complained about you and your actions.
[12:25 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: And those people are assholes.
[12:25 AM] Slorany: For instance joining call for "background noise"
[12:25 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: Yes, forgive me for having suicidal depression.
[12:25 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: I'll try to be less social in the future.
[12:26 AM] Slorany: And using halfconvo for something else than its purpose: being the text medium for the voicechat people
[12:26 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: Halfconvo is clearly for shitposting.
[12:26 AM] Slorany: No
[12:26 AM] Jasper: also, posting progress about your conlang in #main while a different conversation is happening
[12:26 AM] Slorany: it is for posting links, images, for when you're on a call
[12:26 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: Yes, that's how it has been used for as long as this channel has been here.
[12:26 AM] Jasper: also, posting progress about your conlang in #main while a different conversation is happening
[12:26 AM] Jasper: essentially interrupting everyone
[12:26 AM] Slorany: so of course you're not gonna understand why it' sthere since you don't have the context
[12:27 AM] Jasper: to get back to it, your copypasta in venting was completely inappropriate
[12:27 AM] salp: honestly, deflecting the blame onto other people and then onto your mental illness is pretty indicative
[12:28 AM] Slorany: > And those people are assholes.
...rude(edited)
[12:28 AM] salp: it seems you don't seem to care at all about the server and are just using it as entertainment and as a place to post whatever you want wherever
[12:28 AM] salp: but it ends up coming across as very spammy
[12:28 AM] Jasper: to be completely fair, you're not the only one with suicidal depression
[12:28 AM] Jasper: yet you're the only one we're getting complaints about
[12:28 AM] Slorany: How is it being an asshole to just say "hey this guy does things that bother me, please tell him to stop since you're a mod"?
And they also have told you directly
[12:28 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: Fuck you too.
[12:28 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: I'm reporting you to the admins.
[12:28 AM] Melpomenë (en es)[la grc ar]<sc>: @monowhule (en) [eo, jbo] I have a question for you: have you ever joined our previous Skype chat?
[12:29 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: No.
[12:29 AM] Jasper: wait what?
[12:29 AM] salp: which admins lmao
[12:29 AM] Jasper: all we're doing is giving you a friendly warning to watch your actions
[12:29 AM] Jasper: there's no need to get all defensive
[12:29 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: I am seriously offended.
[12:29 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: Like.
[12:29 AM] Slorany: So are we.
[12:29 AM] Jasper: I mean, so are we really
[12:30 AM] salp: mono, if everything around you smells like shit, it might be good to look under your own foot
[12:30 AM] Slorany: We just tell you that people have complained in order for you to try and make it all a bit better.
You just insult those people, and tell us "fuck you".
[12:30 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: Or that I'm around a bunch of shitters.(edited)
[12:30 AM] salp: why are you still here then
[12:31 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: No. You locked me into your shitty little moderator room to berate me.
[12:31 AM] salp: "here" as in "on the server"
[12:31 AM] Jasper: like I said
[12:31 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: And then you have the nerve to make my day worse.
[12:31 AM] Jasper: we're giving you friendly warnings(edited)
[12:31 AM] salp: you've been making people's days worse here all over
[12:31 AM] Jasper: people have been complaining
[12:31 AM] Jasper: then a list of things
[12:31 AM] Slorany: no, jasper
[12:31 AM] Slorany: we were
[12:31 AM] Jasper: please watch your actions
[12:31 AM] salp: you're frankly being incredibly selfish tbh
[12:31 AM] Jasper: that's all
[12:31 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: Fuck you, Salp.
[12:31 AM] Jasper: if you're going to be yelling at us then it's your fault, not ours
[12:31 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: Frankly you're being a shit.
[12:32 AM] Melpomenë (en es)[la grc ar]<sc>: Look at yourself for once
[12:32 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: Stop victim blaming, Mel.
[12:32 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: Seriously, fuck you.
[12:32 AM] Slorany: We aren't victim blaming.
[12:32 AM] Slorany: You aren't the victim here.
[12:32 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: I'm so mad I could cut my wrist open/
[12:32 AM] Jasper: I'm sure that's because of us
[12:33 AM] Jasper: all we wanted to do is just give you some tips on being more liked by the community
[12:33 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: You ARE victim blaming.
[12:33 AM] salp: guilt tripping isn't going to lead you anywhere tbh
[12:33 AM] salp: tell me why we should tolerate you treating us like that
[12:33 AM] Jasper: if you can just calm down then we can go on and set you free
[12:33 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: Fuck you, Salp.
[12:33 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: Fuck you to death.
[12:33 AM] salp: literally no one on the server before has had as many issues with people here as you have
[12:33 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: SO what?
[12:33 AM] Slorany: So maybe you're just a toxic person
[12:33 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: Fuck you.,
[12:34 AM] Melpomenë (en es)[la grc ar]<sc>: Last person this bad was a guy named Shanoxilt
[12:34 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: Seriously, fuck all of you.
[12:34 AM] salp: at this point mono, are you even trying to see eye to eye with any of us
[12:34 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: I;ve never been so mistreated.
[12:34 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: I am so enraged.
[12:34 AM] Jasper: I mean you've been treating our community without any respect
[12:35 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: And Hotkeys is now harrassing me through private messages.
[12:35 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: You all are horrible people.
[12:35 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: And I hope you suffer daily.
[12:35 AM] Slorany: You're rude
[12:35 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: WOW,
[12:35 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: RUde.
[12:35 AM] Slorany: no shit
[12:35 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: HOW TRAGIC.
[12:35 AM] Melpomenë (en es)[la grc ar]<sc>: @monowhule (en) [eo, jbo] do you know lojban?
[12:36 AM] monowhule (en) [eo, jbo]: I know a lot of random languages.
